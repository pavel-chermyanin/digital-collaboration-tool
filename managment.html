                    What do we look for in remote project management tools? Hereâ€™s a little summary of the evaluation
                    criteria we are using:
                </p>
                <ol class="description-tools__list">
                    <li class="description-tools__list-item">
                        The tool needs to be accessed remotely.

                    <li class="description-tools__list-item">
                        The tool is not too heavy, meaning that it works with all kinds of internet connections

                    <li class="description-tools__list-item">
                        There should be a secure cloud storage space and file sharing.

                    <li class="description-tools__list-item">
                        The tool should simplify communication channels.

                    <li class="description-tools__list-item">
                        It should also include productivity and engagement tools.

                <p class="description-tools__text">
                    When we evalute
                    <strong>the tools for remote project management</strong>
                    , we take into consideration four main features. These are the user
                    <strong>interface, usability, integration options and pricing:</strong>
                    is the tool worth the money that you are using?
                </p>
                <p class="description-tools__text">
                    When your team is working remotely, the user interface needs to be attractive but also easy to use
                    from everyoneâ€™s point
                    of view. The usability in general is super important: remote teams typically donâ€™t have any kind of
                    in-house support to
                    help with technical issues. Because of this we expect a remote project management tool to include
                    things such as video
                    tutorials, live chat, webinars, Q&A sections etc.
                </p>
                <p class="description-tools__text">
                    When it comes to integration, itâ€™s very important that the tools are easily connected with other
                    software and apps. This
                    is because for instance with remote teams of freelancers, each member can already be using other
                    tools. If these can be
                    easily integrated for the tool you are choosing for your project, it makes everything run faster.

                        When you have a remote team and projects to manage, it requires laying a new foundation and
                        guidelines for each project.
                        <strong>
                            You as a remote project manager need to gather detailed specs for the project, send out
                            invitations to kickoff meetings
                            and track how the project is progressing
                        </strong>
                        . Even though your team might be in different locations around the world, you still need to get
                        everyone to come
                        together.
